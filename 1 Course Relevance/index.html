        <h2>Engineering Design and Innovation</h3>
          <h3>Course Objectives:</h3>
          <p>1. To develop problem solving ability using programming skills by exploring and proposing solutions to
            realistic/social problems.<br>
            2. To Evaluate alternative approaches, and justify the use of selected tools and methods.<br>
            3. To emphasize learning activities those are long-term, inter-disciplinary and student-centric.<br>
            4. To engage students in rich and authentic learning experiences.<br>
            5. To provide every student the opportunity to get involved either individually or as a group so as to
            develop team skills and learn professionalism.<br>
            6. To develop an ecosystem to promote entrepreneurship and research culture among the students</p>
          <h3>Course Relevance:</h3>
          <p class="content"> Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in
            areas of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched
            with semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve
            socially relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various
            socially relevant domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City,
            Smart Energy and Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan.<br><br>
            To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select relevant online courses and
            acquire skills from numerous sources under
            guidance of faculty and enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project
            centric learning. Modern world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of
            projects. In short, if students are prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a
            project-based world. It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. </p>

            <p class="content">Software project development comes under the category of project based
              learning (PBL). PBL is an instructional approach designed to give students the opportunity to
              develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems
              they may face in the real world by using domain specific language technologies. PBL is
              "learning by doing."<br><br>
              Modern world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if
              students are prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is
              a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. Project based learning will also redefine the
              role of teacher as mentor in the learning process.
